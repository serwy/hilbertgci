Hilbert Phase Methods for Glottal Activity Detection

Roger D. Serwy

# Introduction

This repository contains code for performing glottal activity detection
on electroglottographic and acoustic speech signals. The primary approach
makes use of the Hilbert transform and its phase to isolate glottal closures.

# Running

The "demo" files show examples of GADFLI and QuickGCI applied to waveforms.
